- This is a 3D printing software.
- This software is used for converting the stl file into gcode.
- Here we can specify the strength and durability of the materail.
- And also the time ultimaker will take to print the design will also be shown.

-123D SOFTWARE




123D Design uses a simple and intuitive graphical user interface that places your toolbox on the top and the view tools right beneath it, with the design area taking the rest of the space. The icons of the toolbox items are very indicative of their functionality, and they spawn items list when clicked. The approach of placing something in the design area is not the usual “drag n drop” but the more convenient “click and place”. Drag and drop may be used later to refine the position of an item though, but that is camera-dependent as it works with vertical and perpendicular vectors. By clicking the item after its placement, you can change its properties (height, length, etc).

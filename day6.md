## LASER CUTTER

The laser cutter is one of the most useful tools in a modern shop. Laser cutters work by directing a very powerful laser beam, at a precise focal length, onto a material which they either cut or etch, depending on how the laser cutter has been set up. Laser cutters cut materials similarly to other computer controlled tools, only they do so using a beam of light as opposed to a blade. When laser cutters are set up to etch something on the surface of a material, they operate like a printer, literally using their laser beam to etch an image onto something.

- Using the Laser Cutter

     - STEP 1: Load the design file using any designing softwares.

     - STEP 2: Select the Print option from the File dropdown menu.

     - STEP 3: Select the laser cutter from Select printer.

     - STEP 4: Chose the required power and speed
               The Power setting determines exactly that. You can control how much power will be applied to the laser while printing.                  The more power- the more heat, and the more heat- the greater the chance of fire.The speed you choose, determines how                    fast the laser will travel while cutting. The slower the speeds, the longer the laser sits in each spot, which yields                    more heat…and I think you see where this is going. It also means that the slower the speed, the deeper the cut or                        engraving will be.
 
     - STEP 5: Choose between Vector and Raster options
         
      - STEP 6: In the Print Preferences, click the “Auto Focus” button. This will ensure the laser is the proper distance away from                     whatever you’re cutting to get the most accurate cuts.

       - STEP 7: Place the material and set X,Y Coordinates

                
Once on, open the case, place your material where ever you plan to cut. This is where the rulers from the image come in                  handy, hopefully the laser cutter you’re using has built in rulers to help you situate things. (If you’re placing                        something in the upper left corner, and the bed is raised to high, do the following step first).

                
       
Once everything is placed, you may need to adjust the bed. If you look on the front control panel of the Laser Cutter,                  there should be a focus button. If you push that, and then the down arrow, you should see the bed lower. Keep lowering                  the bed until you have enough space that the laser will not come into contact with your materials. Extra space here is                  fine, we’re going to let the machine focus itself later.

- STEP 8: [Optional] Test run the design file Click GO with the lid of the laser cutter open. Laser Cutter won’t print with the                   lid open, so it’s a good way to do a test run on your piece.
- STEP 9:Switch on the air pump to exhaust the gases produced durning cutting
-STEP 19:Press GO with lid closed to cutting your design

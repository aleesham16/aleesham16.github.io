## Electronics Production and CNC
Our aim in this section was to complete PCB milling and cutting and also to solder the PCB. Unfortunately we coulnâ€™t accomplish this due to technical crisis.Anyway I have listed the basic knowledge we got through the course.

Basic Information
What is Electronics Production ? Jaseel sir gave us a basic idea of what is done in Electronics production using the CNC (Computer Numerical Control Router).

What is CNC? CNC router (Or Computer Numerical Control router) is a computer-controlled cutting machine related to the hand held router used for cutting various hard materials, such as wood, composites, aluminium, steel, plastics, and foams. 


- SHOPBOT CNC


    CNC stands for computer numerical control. A CNC can be used in the production of many different items, such as printed circuit board, door carvings, interior and exterior decorations, wood panels, sign boards, wooden frames, moldings, musical instruments, furniture, and so on.

The main component is a board. We use copper boards even though silver boards are better since the latter is expensive. FR-4 board is used in the lab. There are available i 2  sizes.  
     - 1/32 which is maainly used for cuttting.
     - 1/64 which is mainly ised for hutching
     
The software used  is EAGLE (Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor) , a scriptable electronic design automation application with schematic capture, printed circuit board layout, auto-router and computer-aided manufacturing features. 
  
  
  # STEPS FOR PCB MILLING.
- The image for PCB Milling is downloaded from FABMODULES. Now image is opened in the software as input in SPB format. 
- Now select the output form.
- Next select the process foam rough cut(1/8).

- Now select the parameters as below.

- And now click save. Now an SPB File will be downloaded.
   
- Now open the SHOPBOT3 software.
          Set  x, y, z parameters to 0.

 - Now switch on the machine.
 - Next thing to do is stick the PCB so that it stays firm. Take care so that the sacrificial layer is not damaged.
 - Now start printing the PCB.
